mrpdaemon GtkSourceView Theme
=============================

This is my custom GtkSourceView theme for doing coding with various
languages. It is loosely inspired from Eclipse and GNOME 3 colors, with my own
preferences mixed in here and there. GtkSourceView is the syntax highlighting
engine used by many GTK+ applications such as Gedit, MonoDevelop, Anjuta etc.
and this theme can be used with all of those.

## Installing

For Gedit just choose Edit->Preferences->Fonts&Colors, click the '+' icon to
add a new theme and select mrpdaemon.xml from where it is downloaded.
